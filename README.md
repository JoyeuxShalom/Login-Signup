# Login-Signup codes
These codes make-up a login/sign-up page that will allow users to view some content after signing up and then login.

With this implementation, when the user logs in or signs up successfully, we hide the login/signup forms and display the protected content section on the same page. The "protected-content" div will be set to display: none initially, and we'll toggle its visibility based on the user's login status.
